# careerfair: Cyber Security / Digital Forensics Exercise

This PHP-based website was built to provide 5th graders (and other students) with a hands-on Cyber Security / Digital Forensics exercise compatible with their school Chromebooks.  Built and tested with Chrome and Chromium.  Should work from any platform that can run either browser with JavaScript enabled.

Used at the Council Bluffs (Iowa) Centenary Rotary Club's 5th Grade Career Fair held each April in 2016, 2017, 2018, and, soon, 2019.  It was also used in a presentation to the Woodrow Wilson Middle School Tech Club in October 2016 and in various places thereafter.

There's a scoring bug I've left unfixed after the happy coincidence of students finding it.

This hands-on exercise is paired with a talk on Cyber Security and Digital Forensics as (amazing) careers.

Could be cleaner and better-documented.  Such is life.
